# Tutorial paths

As you can see, we have tons of tutorials in this documentations, and we will keep adding more as new features come out. If you're not looking for anything specific, it can be a little difficult to know where to start. For that reason, here are some interesting itineraries to take your first steps in the library!



:::tip First steps in the library

The best place to start is playing the core components of our library. These are the basic building blocks you will need in all the apps you build on top of this!

- ðŸ“˜ [Create your first 3D app](../Tutorials/SimpleScene.mdx) 

- ðŸ“˜ [Interact with your scene](../Tutorials/SimpleRaycaster.mdx) 
- ðŸ“˜ [Create some clipping planes](../Tutorials/SimpleRaycaster.mdx) 

- ðŸ“˜ [Use some tools](../Tutorials/ToolsComponent.mdx)

:::danger Making great 3D apps

Basics are great, but that's not enough to build professional 3D apps. Let's discover some tools that will bring our BIM software to the next level:

- ðŸ“™ [Using a fancy camera](../Tutorials/OrthoPerspectiveCamera.mdx) 

- ðŸ“™ [Building scalable 3D scenes](../Tutorials/ScreenCuller.mdx)

- ðŸ“™ [Setting up beatiful graphics](../Tutorials/PostproductionRenderer.mdx)

- ðŸ“™ [Creating UI fast](../Tutorials/UIManager.mdx)

- ðŸ“™ [Creating a minimap](../Tutorials/MiniMap.mdx)

- ðŸ“™ [Casting shadows](../Tutorials/ShadowDropper.mdx)

- ðŸ“™ [Clipping edges](../Tutorials/EdgesClipper.mdx)

- ðŸ“™ [Measuring distances](../Tutorials/LengthMeasurement.mdx)

:::info Loading and editing BIM data

We are here to make BIM apps, and the library has tons of tools to make it super easy! Our library is based on [fragments](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_fragment), an open source geometric format that can load display big amounts of BIM data super efficiently. Let's learn how to build BIM apps with it!

- ðŸ“• [Discovering fragments](../Tutorials/FragmentManager.mdx)

- ðŸ“• [Loading IFC files](../Tutorials/FragmentIfcLoader.mdx)

- ðŸ“• [Touching BIM models](../Tutorials/FragmentHighlighter.mdx)

- ðŸ“• [Exploding models](../Tutorials/FragmentExploder.mdx)

- ðŸ“• [Caching BIM data](../Tutorials/FragmentCacher.mdx)

- ðŸ“• [Navigating floorplans](../Tutorials/FragmentPlans.mdx)

- ðŸ“• [Reading properties](../Tutorials/IfcPropertiesProcessor.mdx)

- ðŸ“• [Building trees](../Tutorials/FragmentTree.mdx)

- ðŸ“• [Filtering geometry](../Tutorials/FragmentHider.mdx)

- ðŸ“• [Writing properties](../Tutorials/IfcPropertiesManager.mdx)
