# 🧭 Tutorial paths

As you can see, we have **tons of tutorials** in this documentations, and we will keep adding more as new features come out. If you're not looking for anything specific, it can be a little difficult to know where to start. For that reason, here are some interesting itineraries to **take your first steps in the library**! 🔥🔥🚀

:::tip First steps in the library

The best place to start is **playing with the core** components of our library. These are the basic building blocks you will need in all the apps you build on top of this! 👶🏻

- 📘 [Create your first 3D app](../Tutorials/Components/Core/Worlds.mdx) 

- 📘 [Set up a grid](../Tutorials/Components/Core/Grids.mdx) 

- 📘 [Interact with your scene](../Tutorials/Components/Core/Raycasters.mdx) 

- 📘 [Create some clipping planes](../Tutorials/Components/Core/Clipper.mdx)

:::danger Making great 3D apps

Basics are great, but that's not enough to **build professional 3D apps**. Let's discover some components that will bring our BIM software to the next level: 🆙

- 📙 [Use a fancy camera](../Tutorials/Components/Core/OrthoPerspectiveCamera.mdx) 

- 📙 [Set up beatiful graphics](../Tutorials/Components/Front/PostproductionRenderer.mdx)

- 📙 [Cast shadows](../Tutorials/Components/Core/ShadowedScene.mdx)

- 📙 [Create clipping edges](../Tutorials/Components/Front/ClipStyler.mdx)

- 📙 [Measure distances](../Tutorials/Components/Front/LengthMeasurement.mdx)

- 📙 [Create UIs fast](../Tutorials/UserInterface/)

:::info Loading and editing BIM data

We are here to make BIM apps, and the library has **tons of components** to make it super easy! Our library is based on [fragments](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_fragment), an open source geometric format that can load display big amounts of BIM data super efficiently. Let's learn **how to build BIM apps with it**! 💪🏻

- 📕 [Load IFC files](../Tutorials/Components/Core/IfcLoader.mdx)

- 📕 [Discover fragments](../Tutorials/Components/Core/FragmentsManager.mdx)

- 📕 [See your loaded models](../Tutorials/UserInterface/OBC/ModelsList.mdx)

- 📕 [Meet your model properties](../Tutorials/UserInterface/OBC/ItemsData.mdx)

<!-- - 📕 [Touching BIM models](../Tutorials/FragmentHighlighter.mdx) -->

<!-- - 📕 [Navigating floorplans](../Tutorials/FragmentPlans.mdx) -->

<!-- - 📕 [Building trees](../Tutorials/UserInterface/OBC/RelationsTree.mdx) -->

- 📕 [Filter geometry](../Tutorials/Components/Core/Hider.mdx)

<!-- - 📕 [Writing properties](../Tutorials/IfcPropertiesManager.mdx) -->
