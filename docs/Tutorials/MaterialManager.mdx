### 👨‍🎨 Seamless Material Control
---
Have you ever had trouble handling multiple **Materials** for your BIM project?
You may be asking why different **Materials** are required. Sometimes you need to highlight a mesh
or group the meshes, and render them with different materials; the possibilities are limitless.💫
:::tip First, let's set up a simple scene!
👀 If you haven't started there, check out [that tutorial first](SimpleScene.mdx)!
:::
In this tutorial, we use **MaterialManager** to control materials for various meshes.
We will also show you how to adjust the background of your scene.🌗
### 🧱 Creating Multiple Meshes
---
Now that our scene setup is done, let's add 3D elements to our scene as well.
We will add [Box Geometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry)
and [Sphere Geometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/SphereGeometry) along with a material.🖌️
#### Grouping the Meshes
🗃️ To make things easier to understand and use, we will categorize and store meshes into **`cubes[]`** and **`spheres[]`**.

```js
const cubes = [];
const spheres = [];
const boxGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(2, 2, 2);
const sphereGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(2, 8, 8);
const material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: '#6528D7' });
```
#### Changing Positions
We have made preparations for adding mesh to our scene; but, if we do not alter their placements,
all the meshes will be rendered in the same location, which is `(0,0,0)`.📍
:::info Randomising the Cube Placement
We'll write a quick **utility** function that returns a random number between 0 and the specified upper limit.
You can use this for a variety of purposes, but for this tutorial
it will be used to generate random positions for cube and sphere placement.📌
:::

```js
function getRandomNumber(limit) {
return Math.random() * limit;
}
```
### 🧪 Generating Cubes and Spheres
Now, we will write a simple **`for loop`** which will generate **3 Cubes** and **3 Sphere** meshes.
In addition, we will use the `getRandomNumber` function that we defined before and add the meshes to the scene with updated positions.🔮

```js
function generateCubes() {
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(boxGeometry, material);
cube.position.x = getRandomNumber(10);
cube.position.y = getRandomNumber(10);
cube.position.z = getRandomNumber(10);
cube.updateMatrix();
scene.add(cube);
cubes.push(cube);
}
}
function generateSpheres() {
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
const sphere = new THREE.Mesh(sphereGeometry, material);
sphere.position.x = getRandomNumber(10);
sphere.position.y = getRandomNumber(10);
sphere.position.z = getRandomNumber(10);
sphere.updateMatrix();
scene.add(sphere);
spheres.push(sphere);
}
}
generateCubes();
generateSpheres();
```
### 🎨 Materials Made Easy
---
Here comes the interesting part! We will now use **[Material Manager](../api/classes/components.MaterialManager)**
for manipulating the materials and background. Let's create different materials for Cubes and Spheres.🎭

```js
const materialManager = new OBC.MaterialManager(components);
const backgroundColor = new THREE.Color("white");
const cubeColor = new THREE.Color(0x71d728);
const cubeMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: cubeColor});
const sphereColor = new THREE.Color(0xd7286b);
const sphereMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: sphereColor});
```
:::tip Syncing Components with your own theme!
🔥 You may have noticed that we are also implementing `backgroundColor`,
which will allow you to modify the background of your scene with a single call!
With components, you can now modify the background of your BIM app to match the theme you're using.
:::
#### Storing the Material with Manager
Now that the materials have been created, we will `name` them and use **`addMaterial`** to store them in `materialManager`.
Next, we'll add the necessary meshes to help **materialManager** to choose which mesh to use when applying materials.🧮

```js
materialManager.addMaterial("cubeMaterial", cubeMaterial);
materialManager.addMeshes("cubeMaterial", cubes);
materialManager.addMaterial("sphereMaterial", sphereMaterial);
materialManager.addMeshes("sphereMaterial", spheres);
```
### 🚦 Controlling the Manager Events
---
With all the things in place, we will use `dat.GUI` for controlling the materials!
- `materialManager.set(boolean, ["materialName", ..])` - You can use this API to change the active material for a mesh group.
- `materialManager.setBackgroundColor(Color) - This API will help you to change the background of your scene.

```js
const gui = new dat.GUI();
const actions = {
changeSphereMaterial: () => {
materialManager.set(true, ["sphereMaterial"]);
},
changeCubeMaterial: () => {
materialManager.set(true, ["cubeMaterial"]);
},
changeBackground: () => {
materialManager.setBackgroundColor(backgroundColor);
},
reset: () => {
materialManager.set(false, ["cubeMaterial" , "sphereMaterial"]);
materialManager.resetBackgroundColor();
}
};
```
Great job! 🎉 Now you know how to manage multiple materials in your app using
**[Material Manager](../api/classes/components.MaterialManager)** component! 💪
Your BIM software can be made more visually appealing and aesthetically pleasing.
Let's keep it up and check out another tutorials!
