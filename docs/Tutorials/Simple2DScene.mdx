### ðŸŽ¨ Draw in 2D on top of 3D!
___
The `Simple2DScene` component is an easy way to represent 2D data
using the same tools and API that you use for 3D. Using it is
super simple: just create a new instance and you can start
adding things to it!
:::tip Drawing 2D with THREE.js?
Yes! 2D is just a specific case of 3D. So we can use exactly the same
libraries and tools to display 2D data easily.
:::
The first step is to create a instance of the `Simple2DScene` component:

```js
const simple2dScene = new OBC.Simple2DScene(components);
```
Great! Now we can start adding things to it, just like we would with the
3D scene. We will create a cube some lights and a grid: ðŸ’¡ðŸ§Š

```js
const cube2 = new THREE.Mesh(boxGeometry, boxMaterial);
const scene2d = simple2dScene.get();
scene2d.add(cube2);
const directionalLight2 = new THREE.DirectionalLight();
directionalLight2.position.set(5, 10, 3);
directionalLight2.intensity = 0.5;
scene2d.add(directionalLight2);
const ambientLight2 = new THREE.AmbientLight();
ambientLight2.intensity = 0.5;
scene2d.add(ambientLight2);
const grid2d = new THREE.GridHelper(1000, 1000);
grid2d.rotation.x = Math.PI / 2;
scene2d.add(grid2d);
```
### ðŸ’… Creating the UI
___
The `Simple2DScene` comes with a button to easily turn it on and off.
Let's create a simple toolbar and add it to the scene:

```js
const mainButton = simple2dScene.uiElement.get("main");
const mainToolbar = new OBC.Toolbar(components);
components.ui.addToolbar(mainToolbar);
mainToolbar.addChild(mainButton);
```
That's it! Great work. Now you can easily draw 2D graphics with the same
API and expose them to your end users. ðŸ¥³
