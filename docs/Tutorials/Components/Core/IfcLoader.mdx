### 🏠👉🤖 From IFC to fragment in 1 minute
___
Fragments are great: they are lightweight, they are fast and we
have tons of tools to work with them. But fragments are not used
outside our libraries. So how can we convert an IFC file to fragments?
Easy: with the `FragmentIfcLoader`! Let's start by creating it.

```js
import * as WEBIFC from "web-ifc";
import * as BUI from "@thatopen/ui";
import Stats from "stats.js";
import * as OBC from "../..";

const container = document.getElementById("container")!;

const components = new OBC.Components();

const worlds = components.get(OBC.Worlds);

const world = worlds.create<
  OBC.SimpleScene,
  OBC.SimpleCamera,
  OBC.SimpleRenderer
>();

world.scene = new OBC.SimpleScene(components);
world.renderer = new OBC.SimpleRenderer(components, container);
world.camera = new OBC.SimpleCamera(components);

components.init();

world.camera.controls.setLookAt(12, 6, 8, 0, 0, -10);

world.scene.setup();

const grids = components.get(OBC.Grids);
grids.create(world);
```
:::info Why not just IFC?
IFC is nice because it lets us exchange data with many tools in the
AECO industry. But it also has some limitations. In a nutshell,
data coming from IFC needs to be processed and converted to triangles
to be able to draw it in 3D, and that requires processing power
and time! That's why we convert it to fragments to display it.
Once you have the fragments, you can store them and load them
directly the next time your user tries to load that IFC: it will
load 10 times faster!
:::
### 🔭🔧 Calibrating the converter
___
Now, we need to configure the path of the WASM files. What's WASM?
It's a technology that lets us run C++ on the browser, which means
that we can load IFCs super fast! These files are the compilation of
our `web-ifc` library. You can find them in the github repo and in NPM.
These files need to be available to our app, so you have 2 options:
- Download them and serve them statically.
- Get them from a remote server.
The easiest way is getting them from unpkg, and the cool thing is that
you don't need to do it manually! It can be done directly by the tool
just by writing the following:

```js
const fragments = components.get(OBC.FragmentsManager);
const fragmentIfcLoader = components.get(OBC.IfcLoader);
```
Awesome! Optionally, we can exclude categories that we don't want
to convert to fragments like very easily:

```js
await fragmentIfcLoader.setup();

/* If you want to the path to unpkg manually, then you can skip the line
  above and set them manually as below:
  fragmentIfcLoader.settings.wasm = {
      path: "https://unpkg.com/web-ifc@0.0.53/",
      absolute: true
  }
```
We can further configure the conversion using the `webIfc` object.
In this example, we will make the IFC model go to the origin of
the scene (don't worry, this supports model federation) and
optimize the profiles geometry so that it generates very
efficient geometry for certain geometries (e.g. HVAC):

```js
const excludedCats = [
  WEBIFC.IFCTENDONANCHOR,
  WEBIFC.IFCREINFORCINGBAR,
  WEBIFC.IFCREINFORCINGELEMENT,
];

for (const cat of excludedCats) {
  fragmentIfcLoader.settings.excludedCategories.add(cat);
}
```
### 🚗🔥 Loading the IFC
___
Next, let's define a function to load the IFC programmatically.
We have hardcoded the path to one of our IFC files, but feel free
to do this with any of your own files!
:::info Opening local IFCs
Keep in mind that the browser can't access the file of your
computer directly, so you will need to use the Open File API to
open local files.
:::

```js
fragmentIfcLoader.settings.webIfc.COORDINATE_TO_ORIGIN = true;
fragmentIfcLoader.settings.webIfc.OPTIMIZE_PROFILES = true;
```
### 🎁 Exporting the result
___
Once you have your precious fragments, you might want to save them
so that you don't need to open this IFC file each time your user
gets into your app. Instead, the next time you can load the
fragments directly. Defining a function to export fragments
is as easy as this:

```js
// const cullers = components.get(OBC.Cullers);
// const culler = cullers.create(world);
// culler.enabled = true;

async function loadIfc() {
  const file = await fetch("https://thatopen.github.io/engine_components/resources/small.ifc");
  const data = await file.arrayBuffer();
  const buffer = new Uint8Array(data);
  const model = await fragmentIfcLoader.load(buffer);
  model.name = "example";
  world.scene.three.add(model);
  // for (const mesh of model.children) {
  //   culler.add(mesh as any);
  // }
}

// world.camera.controls.addEventListener("sleep", () => {
//   culler.needsUpdate = true
// })
```
### 🧠🧼 Cleaning memory
___
Now, just like in the `FragmentManager` tutorial, you will need
to dispose the memory if your user wants to reset the state of the
scene, especially if you are using Single Page Application
technologies like React, Angular, Vue, etc. To do that, you
can simply call the `dispose` method:

```js
function download(file: File) {
  const link = document.createElement("a");
  link.href = URL.createObjectURL(file);
  link.download = file.name;
  document.body.appendChild(link);
  link.click();
  link.remove();
}

async function exportFragments() {
  if (!fragments.groups.size) {
    return;
  }
  const group = Array.from(fragments.groups.values())[0];
  const data = fragments.export(group);
  download(new File([new Blob([data])], "small.frag"));

  const properties = group.getLocalProperties();
  if (properties) {
    download(new File([JSON.stringify(properties)], "small.json"));
  }
}
```
That's it! Congrats, now you can load IFC files into your app,
generate the 3D geometry and property data for them and navigate
them in 3D. In other tutorials, you'll find tons of tools to
work with them and create amazing BIM apps! See you there 💪

```js
function disposeFragments() {
  fragments.dispose();
}
```
