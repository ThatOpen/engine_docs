### 🤏 Touching things
___
In this tutorial, we'll learn to **interact with our scene**. This will work both for a mouse 🐀 and for the touch
screen of a phone 📱 or tablet 🍎. This might sound daunting, but it's actually very easy! Let's see **how to do that
in 5 minutes**.
:::tip First, let's set up a simple scene!
If you haven't started there, check out [that tutorial first](SimpleScene.mdx)!
:::
Next, we will add some objects to pick. We need 5 meshes that can share the same cube geometry
(as all the geometry of the cubes is the same).

```js
const cubeMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({color: '#6528D7'});
const greenMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({color: '#BCF124'});
const boxGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(3, 3, 3);
const cube1 = new THREE.Mesh(boxGeometry, cubeMaterial);
const cube2 = new THREE.Mesh(boxGeometry, cubeMaterial);
const cube3 = new THREE.Mesh(boxGeometry, cubeMaterial);
scene.add(cube1, cube2, cube3);
const cubes = [cube1, cube2, cube3];
```
Let's give the cubes a different position so that we can see all of them in the scene:

```js
cube2.position.x = 5;
cube3.position.x = -5;
```
### 🔄 Spinning up the cubes
___
To spice things up a little, let's create an animation loop that rotates the cubes each frame. You can do this super
easily by creating a function and adding it to the `beforeUpdate` event of the **RendererComponent** inside
**Components** using the `on()` method:

```js
const oneDegree = Math.PI / 180;
function rotateCubes() {
cube1.rotation.x += oneDegree;
cube1.rotation.y += oneDegree;
cube2.rotation.x += oneDegree;
cube2.rotation.z += oneDegree;
cube3.rotation.y += oneDegree;
cube3.rotation.z += oneDegree;
}
components.renderer.onBeforeUpdate.add(rotateCubes);
```
:::info Turning off animations
You can turn off animations simply by using the `off()` method.
[This works for any event](../api/classes/components.Event)
in the library! ⌚
:::
### ⚡ Casting rays around
___
Finally, we will use the raycaster. This is very easy using the
**[raycaster component](../api/classes/components.SimpleRaycaster)**, which solves this for all screen sizes.
We will create an event that fires every time that the user moves the mouse. 👇
:::warning How does it really work?
We will simply reset the material of the previous selection (if it exists), and then apply the green material to the
found object (if any). This might sound like a lot, but it's actually very little code. 😉
:::

```js
let previousSelection;
window.onmousemove = () => {
const result = components.raycaster.castRay(cubes);
if (previousSelection) {
previousSelection.material = cubeMaterial;
}
if (!result) {
return;
}
result.object.material = greenMaterial;
previousSelection = result.object;
}
```
Great job! 🎉 Now you know how to pick geometry in your 3D scene using a
**[raycaster component](../api/classes/components.SimpleRaycaster)** component! 💪 You are now one step closer
to build your own BIM software. Let's keep it up and check out another tutorials!
