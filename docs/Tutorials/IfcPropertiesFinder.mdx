### ðŸ”Ž Find just what you need
___
Sometimes data is buried inside our BIM models, and the
heterogeneity of BIM models doesn't make it easier. Luckily,
we have created a component that can go past this barrier:
the `IfcPropertiesFinder`.
:::info How can it find buried data?
Best way to describe the component is to find "Relations of entities meeting a set of attributes criteria".
Each search group aims to find a set of entities matching the criteria and then its relations.
The search result are all common relations of the entities that meet the criteria in each search group.
:::
Let's see how it works! As usual, let's start by loading our
classic model:

```js
const fragments = new OBC.FragmentManager(components);
const file = await fetch("../../../resources/small.frag");
const dataBlob = await file.arrayBuffer();
const buffer = new Uint8Array(dataBlob);
const model = await fragments.load(buffer);
const properties = await fetch("../../../resources/small.json");
const props = await properties.json();
model.setLocalProperties(props);
```
Now, we can start the finder by just instancing the class and
calling the `init` method. It's asynchronous, so don't forget
to add an `await` before it! Then, you can make it `queryWindow`
visible to start working with it:

```js
const propsFinder = new OBC.IfcPropertiesFinder(components);
await propsFinder.init();
propsFinder.uiElement.get("queryWindow").visible = true;
```
We will also add a `Toolbar` so that you can see how to hide and
show it using the main built-in `Button` that it has:

```js
const mainToolbar = new OBC.Toolbar(components)
components.ui.addToolbar(mainToolbar)
mainToolbar.addChild(propsFinder.uiElement.get("main"))
```
### âœ¨ Highlighting the results
___
Right now our app is super boring, so let's make this a bit more
interesting. We will highlight the items found by the finder.
Doing this is super easy with the `FragmentHighlighter` and the
finder `onFound` event:

```js
const highlighter = new OBC.FragmentHighlighter(components);
highlighter.setup();
components.renderer.postproduction.customEffects.outlineEnabled = true;
highlighter.outlinesEnabled = true;
highlighter.zoomToSelection = true;
propsFinder.onFound.add(result => {
highlighter.highlightByID("select", result);
})
```
This is it! Now you know how to find data using complex queries
in your BIM models. You can use the finder in combination
with your own tools, like we did with the `FragmentHider`. Let us
make the data heavy lifting for you and just focus on the results!
We'll see you in another tutorial of these docs.
