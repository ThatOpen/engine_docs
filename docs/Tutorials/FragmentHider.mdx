### 🔎 Custom filters for your BIM models
___
BIM models are complex, and finding what we are looking for is not
always easy. Luckily, the components library has tools to make
it easier, and one of them is the 'FragmentHider'. Let's
check it out!
:::info Complex IFC, complex filters
Each IFC is a world. Data is always defined slightly differently,
and defining pre-made filters only works for very basic things
like categories. With the FragmentHider, you'll be able to find
anything, even things defined in custom categories!
:::
First, let's start by creating a `FragmentManager` instance and
loading a simple fragment. If you haven't checked out the tutorial
for that component yet, do it before going forward!

```js
const fragments = new OBC.FragmentManager(components);
const file = await fetch("../../../resources/small.frag");
const dataBlob = await file.arrayBuffer();
const buffer = new Uint8Array(dataBlob);
const model = await fragments.load(buffer);
const properties = await fetch("../../../resources/small.json");
model.properties = await properties.json();
```
Now that we have our model, let's start the `FragmentHider`. You
can use the `loadCached` method if you had used it before: it will
automatically load all the filters you created in previous sessions,
even after closing the browser and opening it again:

```js
const hider = new OBC.FragmentHider(components);
await hider.loadCached();
```
### 📕📗📘 Setting up simple filters
___
Next, we will classify data by category and by level using the
`FragmentClassifier`. This will allow us to create a simple
filter for both classifications. Don't worry: we'll get to
the more complex filters later!

```js
const classifier = new OBC.FragmentClassifier(components);
classifier.byStorey(model);
classifier.byEntity(model);
const classifications = classifier.get();
```
Next, we will create a simple object that we will use as the
base for the floors filter. It will just be a JS object with
the name of each storey as key and a boolean (true/false) as
value:

```js
const storeys = {};
const storeyNames = Object.keys(classifications.storeys);
for (const name of storeyNames) {
storeys[name] = true;
}
```
Now, let's do the same for categories:

```js
const classes = {};
const classNames = Object.keys(classifications.entities);
for (const name of classNames) {
classes[name] = true;
}
```
Finally, we will set up a simple menu in dat.gui to control
the visibility of storeys:

```js
const gui = new dat.GUI();
const storeysGui = gui.addFolder("Storeys");
for (const name in storeys) {
storeysGui.add(storeys, name).onChange(async (visible) => {
const found = await classifier.find({storeys: [name]});
hider.set(visible, found);
});
}
```
Again, for categories it's very similar:

```js
const entitiesGui = gui.addFolder("Classes");
for (const name in classes) {
entitiesGui.add(classes, name).onChange(async (visible) => {
const found = await classifier.find({entities: [name]});
hider.set(visible, found);
});
}
```
Congratulations! Now you know how to create filters for categories
and levels. Easy, right? Well, believe it or not, creating
complex filters is even easier.
### 📚📚 Complex filter queries
___
To create complex filters you can just use the built-in `Button`
that comes with the hider. Let's create a `Toolbar` and add it
to it.

```js
const toolbar = new OBC.Toolbar(components);
components.ui.addToolbar(toolbar);
const hiderButton = hider.uiElement.get("main");
toolbar.addChild(hiderButton);
```
That's it! That button will open a floating menu that will allow
you to create custom multi-filters that work even for custom
property sets and quantity sets, including logical operators.
Try them out in the example below, and check out more tutorials
to bring your BIM apps to the next level!
