### 🧳 Gathering BIM Data
---
Fragment help you to render your BIM files faster than ever.🚅 [**Fragment**](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_fragment) is a group of `FragmentMeshes`
which are clubbed together to visualize the BIM model.
When working with **large** BIM models, you may need to quit the navigation to see the whole model.📌
To accomplish this, we must extract Mesh data from the Fragment and use `control` APIs to display the complete Fragment.
:::tip First, let's set up a simple scene!
👀 If you haven't started there, check out [that tutorial first](SimpleScene.mdx)!
:::
For this tutorial, we'll use the `FragmentBoundingBox` component, which will provide us with the **mesh** by using the Fragment Model.
### 🧩 Adding Fragments
---
We'll start by adding a **Fragment** to our scene using **[FragmentManager](../api/classes/components.FragmentManager)**.
We'll use a simple fragment for the purposes of this tutorial, but the code is capable of handling big files as well.🏗️

```js
const fragments = new OBC.FragmentManager(components);
const file = await fetch("../../../resources/small.frag");
const data = await file.arrayBuffer();
const buffer = new Uint8Array(data);
const model = await fragments.load(buffer);
```
### 🎲 Creation of Bounding Boxes
---
Now that our setup is done, lets see how you can use **[`FragmentBoundingBox()`](../api/classes/components.FragmentBoundingBox)**.
You will be amazed to see how easy it is to create [bounding box](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=bound#api/en/math/Box3) using **components**.💪
We will use `OBC.FragmentBoundingBox()` and add the Fragment model to it using `add(model)`.

```js
const fragmentBbox = new OBC.FragmentBoundingBox(components);
fragmentBbox.add(model);
```
#### 👓 Reading the Mesh Data
After adding the model, we can now read the mesh from bounding box using **`getMesh()`**

```js
const bbox = fragmentBbox.getMesh();
fragmentBbox.reset();
```
### ⏏️ Creating a Toolbar for Navigating the Model
---
We'll make a **Toolbar Component** and set it at the bottom.
In addition, we will add a **zoom in** button to this toolbar that will be used to zoom in at the BIM Model.

```js
const toolbar = new OBC.Toolbar(components, {position: "bottom"});
components.ui.addToolbar(toolbar);
const button = new OBC.Button(components);
button.materialIcon = "zoom_in_map";
button.tooltip = "Zoom to building";
toolbar.addChild(button);
```
:::tip Simplistic and Powerful Toolbar!
🎛️ We have a dedicated tutorial on how to implement **Toolbar**, check **[Toolbar and UIManager](UIManager.mdx)** tutorial if you have any doubts!
:::
### 🎮 Managing Zoom Events
---
Now that all the setup is done, we need to trigger the zoom event on a button click.🖱
We will use `fitToSphere` from **[camera.controls](../api/classes/components.SimpleCamera#controls)**,
which takes the `mesh` as a parameter and zooms to it.
Also, we will enable a nice transition effect while zooming to the mesh by setting the last parameter as **true**

```js
const controls = components.camera.controls;
button.onClick.add(() => {
controls.fitToSphere(bbox, true);
})
```
**Congratulations** 🎉 on completing this short yet useful tutorial!
You can now easily zoom to Fragment **Mesh** using **[FragmentBoundingBox](../api/classes/components.FragmentBoundingBox)**😎
Let's keep it up and check out another tutorial! 🎓
