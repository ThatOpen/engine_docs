### 🚅 Managing Performance
---
There are occasions when your scene has too many components.
Multiple components being rendered simultaneously **lengthens computation time**⌛️ and **degrades performance**.🌡️
:::tip First, let's set up a simple scene!
👀 If you haven't started there, check out [that tutorial first](SimpleScene.mdx)!
:::
In this tutorial, we will use **ScreenCuller** to improve performance by reducing unnecessary computations.🚀
This tutorial will show you how to manage a complex scenario with a lot of elements in an effective way.🦾
### 🧰 Creating Screen Culler
---
Although adding Screen Culler to your project can appear difficult, it is actually rather easy.
Now, we will add **Screen Culler Component**.
This will create a Screen Culler which is now ready to be used.

```js
const culler = new OBC.ScreenCuller(components);
```
Additionally, we will activate the `culler.renderDebugFrame`
so that we can see the 2D screen of the elements that are not occluded.💻
Also, we will get the **domElement** and attach it to the body so that we can see this frame in real-time.📊

```js
culler.renderDebugFrame = true;
const debugFrame = culler.renderer.domElement;
document.body.appendChild(debugFrame);
debugFrame.style.position = 'fixed';
debugFrame.style.left = '0';
debugFrame.style.bottom = '0';
debugFrame.style.visibility = 'collapse';
```
:::info Randomising the Cube Placement
We'll write a quick **utility** function that returns a random number between 0 and the specified upper limit.
You can use this for a variety of purposes, but for this tutorial
it will be used to generate random positions for cube placement.📌
:::

```js
function getRandomNumber(limit) {
return Math.random() * limit;
}
```
### 🧱 Adding a lot of 3D Objects
We'll add the Simple 3D Cube and do it **300 times**!🤯
Components are built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), making it simple to use any three.js code.
For our cube, we'll generate box geometry and use basic material.

```js
const cubes = [];
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(2, 2, 2);
const material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: '#6528D7' });
```
#### 🧪 Generate Multiple Cubes
Now, using the `getRandomNumber()` method we previously created, we will add the 300 **`cube`** meshes to our scene
and randomly position them. We'll add the cube to the scene and adjust its position between 0 and 10.
Additionally, we will add meshes to the `culler` object, which will help **SimpleCuller** to recognize and
draw the elements that are visible to the camera. To do this, **`culler.add(cube)`** will be used.

```js
function regenerateCubes() {
resetCubes();
for (let i = 0; i < 300; i++) {
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
cube.position.x = getRandomNumber(10);
cube.position.y = getRandomNumber(10);
cube.position.z = getRandomNumber(10);
cube.updateMatrix();
scene.add(cube);
culler.add(cube);
cubes.push(cube);
}
}
```
#### 🧹 Cleaning the Scene
Now that we know how to create multiple cubes, we will write a function to remove the cubes from scene on demand.
`resetCubes()` iteratively removes the **cubes** using [**`cube.removeFromParent`**](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=obje#api/en/core/Object3D.removeFromParent).

```js
function resetCubes() {
for (const cube of cubes) {
cube.removeFromParent();
}
cubes.length = 0;
}
```
#### 📢 Rendering Cubes
With everything ready, we will call `regenerateCubes()` which will generate cubes and add them to scene.

```js
regenerateCubes();
```
Here comes the most crucial part! The core aim of **ScreenCuller** is to output just those components that are
visible to the camera.
`culler.needsUpdate = true` instructs the ScreenCuller to render the updated view.
** Remember to update culler every time the camera is updated ❕ **
In this tutorial we are updating it each time the camera stops moving.

```js
culler.needsUpdate = true;
components.camera.controls.addEventListener("controlend", () => {
culler.needsUpdate = true;
});
```
Great job! 🎉 Now you know how to optimise your 3D scene using a
**Screen Culler** component! 💪
Your BIM app will now have unmatched performance and can render huge scenes easily. 🚀
