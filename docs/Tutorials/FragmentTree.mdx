### 🌲 Gathering Structured Insights

---

Building Information Modeling comprises nesting elements in multiple hierarchies.
Working with this information might become complicated and irritating.🤯
**Tree-View** is extremely effective in managing this volume of data.
Using **[Fragment Tree](../api/classes/components.FragmentTree)**, we have made it simple to generate a Tree-View for a fragment.🦾
:::tip First, let's set up a simple scene!
👀 If you haven't started there, check out [that tutorial first](SimpleScene.mdx)!
:::
In this lesson, we'll create a **Tree-View** for the items in the IFC file and zoom in on them when a node is clicked.

### 🧩 Adding Fragments

---

We'll start by adding a **Fragment** to our scene using [**FragmentManager**](../api/classes/components.FragmentManager).
We'll use a simple fragment for the purposes of this tutorial, but the code is capable of handling big files as well.🏗️

```js
const fragments = new OBC.FragmentManager(components);
const file = await fetch("../../../resources/small.frag");
const data = await file.arrayBuffer();
const buffer = new Uint8Array(data);
const model = await fragments.load(buffer);
```

### 🕹 Selection of Fragments

---

Whenever you click on a `node` in **Tree-View**, that particular element would be highlighted.
To create the highlight mechanism, we will use **[Fragment Highlighter](../api/classes/components.FragmentHighlighter)**
that manages the material and selection intuitively.

```js
const highlighter = new OBC.FragmentHighlighter(components, fragments);
highlighter.setup();
```

:::info Highlighting Fragments
🖱Check out **[FragmentHighlighter.mdx](FragmentHighlighter.mdx)** for a detailed tutorial on how to utilize Fragment Highlighter to conduct selection on **IFC files**!
:::

#### Adding Aesthetic Outlines

Now that highlighter setup is done, we will add a nice outline effect when the elements are selected.

```js
components.renderer.postproduction.customEffects.outlineEnabled = true;
highlighter.outlinesEnabled = true;
highlighter.updateHighlight();
```

### 🗂️ Strategically Classifying Fragments

In this tutorial, we will deconstruct the model in order to obtain a hierarchical view.💣
To obtain a nested view, we must first classify them by **floors** and then by **type** entities.
For breaking down the model in the required way, we'll utilize **[Fragment Classifier](../api/classes/components.FragmentClassifier)**.

```js
const classifier = new OBC.FragmentClassifier(components);
```

#### Getting Properties

Fragment Classifier requires model properties that will help the classifier in identifying the floors and entities included inside the Fragment.🧮
We will fetch the properties from `json` file and store it in `model.properties`.

```js
const properties = await fetch("../../../resources/small.json");
model.setLocalProperties(await properties.json());
```

Now that we have the properties, we will pass the model to classifier and use `classifier.byStorey()` which will group the Fragments according to Floors.
The model then needs to be classified according to entities using `classifier.byEntity()`.🗂

```js
classifier.byStorey(model);
classifier.byEntity(model);
```

### 🌱 Building Insightful Tree Views

---

Now comes the interesting part, we will create **`FragmentTree`** using **components** and **classifier**.
In addition, we will update the **Fragment Tree** to produce the Tree-View based on `storeys` and `entities`.

```js
const modelTree = new OBC.FragmentTree(components);
await modelTree.init();
modelTree.update(["storeys", "entities"]);
```

#### 🛎️ Managing Tree-View Events

---

We will zoom in on the element that is selected in the Tree-View and add a nice highlight effect when the user hovers over a tree node.🖱
Let's use `modelTree.onSelected` to get the active selection from Fragment Tree, and we will use `highlighter.highlightByID()` to zoom in.🔍

```js
modelTree.onSelected.add(({ items, visible }) => {
  if (visible) {
    highlighter.highlightByID("select", items, true, true);
  }
});
modelTree.onHovered.add(({ items, visible }) => {
  if (visible) {
    highlighter.highlightByID("hover", items);
  }
});
```

#### 🎨 Rendering the Fragment Tree

---

Now, that all the setup is done we will add the **Fragment Tree** to the **[Toolbar](../api/classes/components.Toolbar)**.
We will use the `addChild()` method to pass the Fragment Tree data to the **Toolbar**
🎛️ Check **[Toolbar and UIManager](./UIManager.mdx)** tutorial if you have any doubts!

```js
const toolbar = new OBC.Toolbar(components);
toolbar.addChild(modelTree.uiElement.get("main"));
components.ui.addToolbar(toolbar);
```

**Cheers and Congratulations** 🎉 on completing this short yet powerful tutorial!
Now, you can provide a structured, navigable, and user-friendly interface to manage, explore, and interact with your BIM models.🥁
Let's keep it up and check out another tutorial! 🎓
