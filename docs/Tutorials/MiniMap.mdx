### 🏂 Navigate through BIM like Pro!
---
BIM Models are large and contain a lot of attributes.
It can become complicated to manage the elements and painfully difficult to navigate around.🌪
Understanding spatial relationships is crucial during the design and evaluation processes.
By having a MiniMap functionality for navigation it makes easier to collaborate and enhance the productivity,
let's see how you can integrate MiniMap in your BIM App! 💥
:::tip First, let's set up a simple scene!
👀 If you haven't started there, check out [that tutorial first](SimpleScene.mdx)!
:::
For this tutorial, we'll use the [**MiniMap**](../api/classes/components.MiniMap) component to create
a navigation functionality!
### 🧩 Adding Fragments
---
We'll start by adding a **Fragment** to our scene using [**FragmentManager**](../api/classes/components.FragmentManager).
We'll use a simple fragment for the purposes of this tutorial, but the code is capable of handling big files as well.🏗️

```js
const fragments = new OBC.FragmentManager(components);
const file = await fetch("../../../resources/small.frag");
const dataBlob = await file.arrayBuffer();
const buffer = new Uint8Array(dataBlob);
fragments.load(buffer);
```
:::info Showing Fragments in the Scene
🏔️ There is a dedicated tutorial on how to use Fragment Manager to load **IFC files**, checkout [that tutorial here](FragmentManager.mdx)!

### 🗺 Integrating Spatial Wonders
---
Now, that we have our setup ready. Let's start with the exciting stuff.
We will use [**Mini Map**](../api/classes/components.MiniMap) component which does all the work for us.🔮
When we create a **Mini Map**, a **Map** element is created at the `bottom-right` of your browser window.

```js
const map = new OBC.MiniMap(components);
components.ui.add(map.uiElement.get("canvas"));
```
#### 🎩 Controlling Maps like a wizard!
---
MiniMap Component makes it easy to add **map** to your app, and it also provides much easier way to manage the **map**.
You can set the scale for map using `map.zoom` or modify the size of **UI** element using `map.getSize()`,
you can find out about more controls [**here**](../api/classes/components.MiniMap#implements) 🎛

```js
map.lockRotation = false;
map.zoom = 0.2;
```
**Congratulations** 🎉 on completing this short yet important tutorial!
Now you can easily add navigation **Map** to your BIM Apps 🎯
Let's keep it up and check out another tutorial! 🎓
